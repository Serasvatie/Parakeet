# Parakeet
Parakeet is a file software manager. The main goals is to rename lot of file with specification and/or sort them by specific string.

# Warning
I highly discourage the usage of this software if you didn't test this soft's functionnality in a safe environment.
The reasons are:
* You can easily remove files & folders.
* You can easilty rename files & folders (don't expect the renaming to work very well if you combine multiple tasks or rename it to some kirky string).
* You can easily move files & folders with a sample Regex that capture a group in the string.
* You can do any task in any folders and sub-folders at the same time.
* Only the DocDistTask is safe because it only use the name of the files & folders to find any similitude in other files & folders names. Other than getting the names, it doesn't do anything to files & folers
